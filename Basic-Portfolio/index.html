            I being of sound mind and body, should probably take things more
            seriously, but I don't. My name is Carl Vega. I am married with my
            first human child that was born on the 30th of March, and a doodle
            child also.

            My desire to begin this BootCamp is due to it being one of my core
            interests. I spend too much time on Gadget/Tech sites. I really
            should get to work, maybe the Adderall can help.

            My other interests are gadgets, productivity, running, our local
            area, and movies or television series. I know most people like
            movies, and television series, but I take pleasure in looking them
            up on Wikipedia or IMDB to see what the people involved have done
            before or upcoming.
