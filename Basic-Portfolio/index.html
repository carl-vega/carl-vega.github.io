                    I being of sound mind and body, should probably take things more seriously, but I don't. My name is Carl Vega. I am married
                    with my first human child that was born on the 30th of March, and a doodle child also.

                    My desire to begin this BootCamp is due to it being one of my core interests. I spend too much time on Gadget/Tech sites.
                    I really should get to work, maybe the Adderall can help.

                    My other interests are gadgets, productivity, running, our local area, and movies or television series. I know most people
                    like movies, and television series, but I take pleasure in looking them up on Wikipedia or IMDB to see
                    what the people involved have done before or upcoming.
