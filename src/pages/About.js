                  To become a retail manager there must be effort put forth, and
                  many lessons learned along the way. But the most important
                  lesson is that change is necessary sometimes to continue to
                  move forward. So, when hard work comes I am resolute, and when
                  an adaptation is required I evolve. This is also my approach
                  to coding, I am determined and flexible.

                  As a techvangelist, I fill my free time viewing different
                  applications and technology theories, viewing the newest
                  gadgets, programs, and technologies. All of this build toward
                  my goal of understanding the latest hardware and software
                  available or in the coming future.

                  On a personal level, I long to establish a gritty personality,
                  but grit is a long-term compounding goal for achieving
                  expertise. That is my philosophy with technology, to go
                  forward and create something that has an impact. It will not
                  happen in a singular moment, but in the multitude of moments
                  that brings me one step closer each time.
